# CS-30-Reflection
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Our client, The Gaming Room, runs a successful mobile app game where players compete in a game called Draw It or Lose It. Our client has hired us to help them make the game more accessible across multiple platforms, specifically focusing on making it for the web.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I carefully analyzed the requirements, compared various platforms and operating systems, and chose the best option.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the document helped me visualize the process of comparing our options, including in our UML diagram. This helped me break down our project, focus on the task at hand more closely, and overall assist me in making a detailed, thought-out decision.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Thinking back to the document, I think I would change my comparison of the Operating systems for our project as I feel I could have made it easier to understand and more digestible, especially for those reviewing the document who might not have the same level of familiarity.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When designing the software for our clients, considering their needs was crucial because it ensures that the software is functional, user-friendly, and meets the user's expectations. By understanding the users ' needs, we created an intuitive design and efficient and easy-to-use software. This helps to enhance the user experience and encourages users to engage with the software, leading to increased productivity and satisfaction.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My software design approach involved understanding the client's requirements, conducting user research, and using iterative design techniques. I emphasize creating a user-centered design, performing usability tests, and refining the software's features based on user feedback. In the future, I plan to improve my design skills by exploring emerging UX/UI trends and involving end-users in the design process through usability testing and feedback sessions.
